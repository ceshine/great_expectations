title: How to configure a Validation Result store on a filesystem
---

import Prerequisites from '../../../guides/connecting_to_your_data/components/prerequisites.jsx';

By default, Validation results are stored in the ``uncommitted/validations/`` directory.  Since Validations may include examples of data (which could be sensitive or regulated) they should notÂ be committed to a source control system.  This guide will help you configure a new storage location for Validations on your filesystem.

This guide will explain how to use a Validation Action to update Data Docs sites with new validation results from Validation Operator runs.

<Prerequisites>

- Configured a [Data Context](../../../tutorials/getting_started/initialize_a_data_context.md).
- Configured an [Expectation Suite ](../../../tutorials/getting_started/create_your_first_expectations).
- Configured a [Checkpoint](../../../guides/validation/checkpoints/how_to_create_a_new_checkpoint).
- Determined a new storage location where you would like to store Validations. This can either be a local path, or a path to a secure network filesystem.

</Prerequisites>

Steps
-----

1. **Configure a new folder on your filesystem where Validation results will be stored.**

   Create a new folder where you would like to store your Validation results, and move your existing Validation results over to the new location. In our case, the name of the Validation result is ``npi_validations`` and the path to our new storage location is ``shared_validations/``.

   ```bash
   # in the great_expectations/ folder
   mkdir shared_validations
   mv uncommitted/validations/npi_validations/ uncommitted/shared_validations/
   ```

2. **Identify your Data Context Validations Store**

   In your ``great_expectations.yml``, look for the following lines.  The configuration tells Great Expectations to look for Validations in a store called ``validations_store``. The ``base_directory`` for ``validations_store`` is set to ``uncommitted/validations/`` by default.

   ```yaml
   validations_store_name: validations_store

   stores:
      validations_store:
          class_name: ValidationsStore
          store_backend:
              class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
              base_directory: uncommitted/validations/
   ```

3. **Update your configuration file to include a new store for Validation results on your filesystem**

   In the example below, Validations Store is being set to ``shared_validations_filesystem_store``, but it can be any name you like.  Also, the ``base_directory`` is being set to ``uncommitted/shared_validations/``, but it can be set to any path accessible by Great Expectations.

   ```yaml
   validations_store_name: shared_validations_filesystem_store

   stores:
      shared_validations_filesystem_store:
          class_name: ValidationsStore
          store_backend:
              class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
              base_directory: uncommitted/shared_validations/
   ```

4. **Confirm that the location has been updated by running** ``great_expectations --v3-api store list``.

   Notice the output contains two Validation stores: the original ``validations_store`` and the ``shared_validations_filesystem_store`` we just configured.  This is ok, since Great Expectations will look for Validations in the ``uncommitted/shared_validations/`` folder as long as we set the ``validations_store_name`` variable to ``shared_validations_filesystem_store``. The config for ``validations_store`` can be removed if you would like.

   ```bash
   great_expectations --v3-api store list

   - name: validations_store
     class_name: ValidationsStore
     store_backend:
       class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
       base_directory: uncommitted/validations/

   - name: shared_validations_filesystem_store
     class_name: ValidationsStore
     store_backend:
       class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
       base_directory: uncommitted/shared_validations/
   ```


5. **Confirm that the Validations store has been correctly configured**

    Run a [Checkpoint](../../../tutorials/getting_started/validate_your_data.md) to store results in the new Validations store on in your new location then visualize the results by re-building [Data Docs](../../../tutorials/getting_started/check_out_data_docs.md).
